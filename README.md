# Employee Management System - Backend

## About the Project

This backend project is part of the Employee Management System, designed to provide robust server-side functionality for managing employees within an organization. The backend effectively implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to ensure seamless management of employee data, supervisor assignments, and organizational hierarchy.

### Key Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Supervisor Assignment**: Assign and update supervisors for employees.
- **Organizational Hierarchy**: View and manage the chain of command.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on employee data.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, providing robust routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
